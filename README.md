    <h3>🚀 About This Repo 🧩</h3>
    This repo is a small hands-on experiment on a random Sunday morning in my hostel room where I explored how Git reacts when two branches modify the same file differently. 🫶<br><br>
    I intentionally created merge conflicts to understand how to fix them cleanly 🧹 and manage branches with clarity and confidence 🌱.
